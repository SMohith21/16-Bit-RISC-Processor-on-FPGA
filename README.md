# 16-Bit-RISC-Processor-on-FPGA
This project involves the design and implementation of a 16-bit single-cycle, non-pipelined RISC processor, written entirely in structural Verilog and deployed on FPGA hardware (Basys 3 board).   The processor supports R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions and is capable of fetching, decoding, executing, memory access, and writing back results.
